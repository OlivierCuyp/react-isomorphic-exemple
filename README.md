# react-isomorphic-exemple

## Description

A quick exemple on how to use expressjs, react, react-router to make a full isomorphic site

This is one of my playground project that I thought might interest other people.

It is not intent to be production ready but just to give you starting point on a full isomorphic website.

The goal here was to share the router and render part, so you don't need an other rendering engine neither to redefine you routes at server side.

## Requirement

Just need to have nodejs installed on your computer.

## Install & setup

Just run `npm install`.

Then build with `node_modules/.bin/gulp` (or if you have gulp installed globally with `gulp`)

If you want to make changes to test, you can also use `node_modules/.bin/gulp watch`.

## Run
Run the `npm start`

## So what then ?

Now you can go to `http://localhost:3000`.

Check that when you disactivate javascript in browser everything still work.

Or if you switch of you server, it still work too.
But I bet you already knew that.

Pease don't hesitate to post any issue/suggestion on the issues list.
